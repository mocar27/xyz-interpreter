Hello

## Files

*Main* file is the main file taking the input and passing it to interpreter.

*Interpreter* file is the file that runs Parser & Lexer on given input, 
then if it returns success it runs TypeChecker, and if the result is successfull
it runs the Evaluator. 

## Some nuances

in the if condition we allow to use int, as bool is actually integer 0/1, if Integer is <= 0, it's false, else true
